    "**Summary:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. SimpleITK supports two ways of combining expert segmentations to obtain a reference segmentation.\n",
    "2. A variety of criteria used for evaluating a segmentation result are readily available or implemented in SimpleITK.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Reference Segmentation</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating segmentation algorithms is most often done using reference data to which you compare your results. In the medical domain reference data is commonly obtained via manual segmentation by an expert (don't forget to thank your clinical colleagues for their hard work). When you are resource limited, the reference data may be defined by a single expert. This is less than ideal. When multiple experts provide you with their input then you can potentially combine them to obtain reference data that is closer to the ever elusive \"ground truth\". In this notebook we show two approaches to combining input from multiple observers, majority vote and the Simultaneous Truth and Performance Level\n",
    "Estimation [(STAPLE)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15250643) algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Segmentation Evaluation</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have a reference, we compare the algorithm's performance using multiple criteria, as usually there is no single evaluation measure that conveys all of the relevant information. In this notebook we illustrate the use of the following evaluation criteria:\n",
    "* Overlap measures:\n",
    "  * Jaccard and Dice coefficients \n",
    "  * false negative and false positive errors\n",
    "* Surface distance measures:\n",
    "  * Hausdorff distance (symmetric)\n",
    "  * mean, median, max and standard deviation between surfaces\n",
    "* Volume measures:\n",
    "  * volume similarity $ \\frac{2*(v1-v2)}{v1+v2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The relevant criteria are task dependent, so you need to ask yourself whether you are interested in detecting spurious errors or not (mean or max surface distance), whether over/under segmentation should be differentiated (volume similarity and Dice or just Dice), and what is the ratio between acceptable errors and the size of the segmented object (Dice coefficient may be too sensitive to small errors when the segmented object is small and not sensitive enough to large errors when the segmented object is large).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of segmentation challenges, algorithm rankings are often based on a weighted combination of these criteria. These ranking schemes are not necessarily robust, as discussed in \"[Why rankings of biomedical image analysis competitions should be interpreted with care](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-07619-7)\", L. Maier-Hein et al.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we use in the notebook is a set of manually segmented liver tumors from a single clinical CT scan. A larger dataset (four scans) is freely available from this [MIDAS repository](http://www.insight-journal.org/midas/collection/view/38). The relevant publication is: T. Popa et al., \"Tumor Volume Measurement and Volume Measurement Comparison Plug-ins for VolView Using ITK\", SPIE Medical Imaging: Visualization, Image-Guided Procedures, and Display, 2006.\n"
